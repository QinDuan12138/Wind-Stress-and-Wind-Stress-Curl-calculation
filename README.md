# Wind-Stress-and-Wind-Stress-Curl-Calculation

This repository provides Python implementations for calculating **wind stress** and **wind stress curl**, offering an accessible alternative to existing MATLAB and FORTRAN scripts.  
Building upon **Ramkrushn Patel’s MATLAB code**, this version refines the **drag coefficient** for high wind speeds and corrects several minor issues to improve accuracy and usability.

The drag coefficient is calculated as follow:
     ┍ 0.00218                                         (U <= 1)
Cd = ├ (0.62 + 1.56 / U) * 0.001                       (1 < U <= 3)
     ├ 0.00114                                         (3 < U <= 10)
     ├ (0.49 + 0.065 * U) * 0.001                      (10 < U <= 19)
     ┖ (1.364 + 0.0234 * U - 0.0002 * U ** 2) * 0.001  (U > 19)

## 🌀 Usage

```python
from windstress import ra_windstr
from windstress_curl import ra_windstrcurl

# Calculate wind stress components
taux_cal, tauy_cal = ra_windstr(u, v)

# Calculate wind stress curl
WSC_cal = ra_windstrcurl(lat, lon, u, v)
```

## 📊 Validation
### Compare our results with the initial wind stress and wind stress curl data
We randomly choose a snapshot (2025-10-20T 12:00) from [Global Ocean Hourly Sea Surface Wind and Stress from Scatterometer and Model](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/WIND_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT_012_004/description) data to validate the our scripts' result.
We use the initial wind to compute the wind stress and wind stress curl. Our result is very simillar to the raw data.
